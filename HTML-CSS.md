# HTML AND CSS 


### DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) SERVER

- In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

- It is the DNS servers that tell your browser how to find the website.

- *When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP)*

- *An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for
   that computer*

### WEB SERVER 

- A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.


### HTML ELEMENTS

- Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something
  about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags. e.g </h>, <p>

- Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

### TAGS

- Note that i won't use > signs in tags 

- The opening `*html*` tag indicates that anything between it and a closing `*/html*` tag is HTML code

- The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing </body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window

- Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading

- A paragraph of text appears between these <p> and </p> tags

- Words between <h2> and </h2> form a sub-heading

- Another sub-heading inside <h2> and </h2> tags

- The closing </body> tag indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window.

- The closing </html> tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code.

- Before the <body> element you will often see a <head> element. This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the 
  browser

- The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that
  page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).

### ATTRIBUTES

- Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value,
  separated by an equals sign.

- The majority of attributes can only be used on certain elements, although a few attributes (such as lang ) can appear on any element.

- The value of the lang attribute is an abbreviated way of specifying which language is used inside the element that all browsers understand.


## HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
