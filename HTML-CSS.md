# HTML AND CSS 


### DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) SERVER

- In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

- It is the DNS servers that tell your browser how to find the website.

- *When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP)*

- *An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for
  that computer*

### WEB SERVER 

- A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.


### HTML ELEMENTS

- Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something
  about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags. e.g </h>, <p>

- Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

### TAGS

- The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code

- The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing </body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window

- Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading

- A paragraph of text appears between these <p> and </p> tags

- Words between <h2> and </h2> form a sub-heading

- Another sub-heading inside <h2> and </h2> tags

- The closing </body> tag indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window.

- The closing </html> tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code.
